## Inspiration
The growing mental health crisis inspired us to create **EchoMind**. With rising stress levels and limited accessible tools for mindfulness, I saw an opportunity to develop a simple, impactful solution for mental wellness. Our goal was to provide an easy-to-use platform that helps people practice guided visualization for stress relief, focus, and better sleep.
## What it does
**EchoMind** is a guided visualization app designed to improve mental well-being. It offers:
- _Stress relief exercises_.
- _Guided meditations to enhance focus_.
-  _Soothing audio tracks for better sleep_.
Users can easily navigate through different categories tailored to their specific needs, making mental wellness more accessible to everyone.
## How I built it
I used no-code tools like **Glide** to create a user-friendly app, making it accessible even for non-technical creators.

The app organizes professionally recorded audio tracks into categories (stress relief, focus, sleep).
A clean, intuitive interface ensures seamless navigation for users of all ages.
I relied on royalty-free audio-video resources and simple design principles for maximum impact.

## Challenges I ran into
Creating **EchoMind** was not without its challenges:

_Audio Organization_: Selecting and categorizing audio tracks effectively for different mental health needs.
_No-Code Limitations_: Ensuring smooth performance and design using no-code platforms like Glide.
_Time Constraints_: Balancing features and functionality within limited development time.
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
